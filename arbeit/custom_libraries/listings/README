The `listings' package is a source code printer for LaTeX.
You can typeset stand alone files as well as listings with
an environment similar to `verbatim' as well as you can
print code snippets using a command similar to \verb'.
Many parameters control the output and if your preferred
programming language isn't already supported, you can make
your own definition.
